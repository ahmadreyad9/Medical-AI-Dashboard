# Medical-AI-Dashboard
Practice project using Python + Streamlit to manage patient data and test a basic diabetes risk model.
# Virtual Medical AI Dashboard

This is a small demo dashboard I built while learning Python and Streamlit.  
It lets you manage patient records, see some charts, and try a simple diabetes risk prediction with Logistic Regression.  

The main goal was practice and learning â€” not a real medical app.
